This fermentation process makes the sorghum so sweet after turning black. It is then dried before it is taken to the machine for grinding to make flour.",
    "step2": "In a bucket or pot, put 2 baskets of sorghum flour. Boil water and mix it flour in the bucket. Keep mixing and ensure the mixture is so thick. The flour should be much. Then add some flour on top of the mixture and leave it to cool.<br/><br/>",

    "step4": "After 4 days, another mixture of sorghum flour mixed with warm water and honey is added. After a day, it is ready for drinking, This makes the taste so sweet but it keeps turning alcoholic depending on the number of days it stays (women prefer to take it in its initial stages while men love it then it has taken some days).",

    "recipe_climate_a": "Due to harsh climatic weather conditions, change of seasons, soil degradation due to chemical use and pests and disease, sorghum growing is slowly reducing in our region and the harvests is no longer bumper as it used to be. While I was growing up, my mother used to harvest between 15- 20 sacks of sorghum on a good harvest. As a small holder farmer, she would sell some and leave others to keep the home food secure at all times. Now, I was surprised to find that she harvests 1 or 3 and 5 utmost when she has exhausted all her land. She told me some of the reasons for poor harvests are poor rains and degraded soils that make the sorghum stunted. This is causing food insecurity and this automatically heavily falls on women who are traditional meant to keep homes food secure and is the source of their livelihood.",
    "recipe_climate_b": "Another issue is on knowledge sharing. The knowledge right from the materials used to making the porridge is slowly disappearing. Initially, the porridge used to be prepared on pots and served in calabashes and gourds but now days the trend is changing to use of buckets and cups. This is because people who used to make them are slowly dying without transferring the knowledge to the young generation. Also the baskets are made out of local grass. These were mainly done by women as source of income. However, the materials are slowly facing extinct and the knowledge is not being transferred to the young generation.",
    "message": "Finally, she explained what this recipe represents to her and why it is important to preserve it to ensure food sovereignty and cultural liberation",
    "precious-message": "This local brown thick drink called ENTURIRE or local porridge is household item for each home. To warmly welcome a visitor, he/she doesnâ€™t have to miss this drink in your home. It is important in home because it keeps away hunger. When you have local porridge, you may end up not eating any food because it keeps one strong. I remember in our school days, my mother, who is a peasant farmer, would prepare it on Sundays to take us throughout the week. Local porridge would stand in a gap of a meal at lunch time whenever she would have no time to cook lunch for us. Two cups were always enough for each of us as lunch to enable us keep strong for the rest of the day at school as we wait to prepare supper. Therefore, the porridge was a big weapon to fight food insecurity in homes. It was meant to keep homes food secure in times of food scarcity, local porridge would stand in the gap.<br />Secondly, it is a symbol of unity and love among the Bakiga tribe because as long as there is local porridge in a home, a guest has to be serving upon visit. At selling points, people drink together and in most cases after getting satisfied, they start dancing in appreciation and unity.<br/>I feel we are missing out on traditional knowledge sharing, sustainable farming methods and indigenous seeds that used to be resistant to harsh climatic conditions. Whereas many crops have been improved, at least cereals are still indigenous though the introduction of modern farming that requires use of chemicals and diversion from traditional methods of keeping soils fertile is affecting the harvests leading to food insecurity. Therefore it is important to promote sustainable methods of farming practices, conserve the environment and promote intergenerational learning to share to transfer knowledge to the young generation.",

A region where women are stolen, raped, and killed at fountains while collecting water, and where women suffer the most from limited access to forest resources imposed by fortress conservation or the degradation of ecosystems. The women from the Albertine Rift collected their recipes to rebuild the identity they had lost over the past 30 years as internally displaced persons as a result of the war that had reached the heart of the Congo Basin, exercising their memory with hope and demanding lasting peace.",
